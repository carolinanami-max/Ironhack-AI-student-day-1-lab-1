        "This notebook demonstrates the creation of two Python functions:\n",
        "1. A greeting function that personalizes messages\n",
        "2. A grade calculator function that converts percentages to letter grades\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reflection Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. What is the main advantage of using functions instead of writing the same code multiple times?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions promote code reusability, reduce duplication, and make code more organized and maintainable. If you need to change the logic (like adjusting grade thresholds), you only need to update it in one place.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. In Exercise 1, why did we use a default parameter value for language?**\n",
        "\n",
        "We used a default parameter to make the function more flexible. Users can call it with just a name, and it will use \"Python\" as the default language. This provides sensible default behavior while still allowing customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. In Exercise 2, why is it important to check the conditions in order from highest to lowest (90, then 80, then 70, etc.)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Checking conditions from highest to lowest ensures that we match the correct grade bracket. If we checked 60+ first, a score of 95 would incorrectly get a \"D\" instead of \"A\" because it satisfies the first condition it encounters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. How did the pseudocode help you in Exercise 2? What would have been different if you had to write it from scratch?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The pseudocode provided a clear roadmap of the logic needed. It outlined the conditional structure and return values, making the implementation straightforward. Without pseudocode, I would have spent more time planning the logic and might have missed edge cases."
